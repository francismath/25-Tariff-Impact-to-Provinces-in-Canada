# 25-Tariff-Impact-to-Provinces-in-Canada

The goal of this project is to analyze the industrial structure of all provinces in Canada and assess the potential impact of a 25% tariff threat from the U.S. in 2025. The analysis will be conducted using GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and Power BI separately. 

1.	Objective: Understand the industrial structure of Canadian provinces and simulate the potential impact of a 25% U.S. tariff on trade, employment, and GDP.
2.	Scope: Focus on key industries including manufacturing, agriculture, energy, technology and their geographic distribution across provinces.
3.	Outputs:
  o	GIS: Spatial maps showing industrial concentration and vulnerability to tariffs.
  o	Power BI: Interactive dashboards for economic and trade impact analysis.

Data Source: 
1.	Industrial and Economic Data:

      o	Provincial GDP by industry (Statistics Canada).

      o	Employment by industry and province (Labour Force Survey, Statistics Canada).

2.	Trade and Tariff Data:
   
      o	Current U.S.-Canada trade flows by industry (Statistics Canada, US International Trade Commission, US Census Bureau).

  	  o	Historical tariff data (World Bank, WTO).

3.	Geospatial Data:

      o	Provincial and regional boundaries (Natural Resources Canada).
  
      o	Location of key industries (still figuring out).
  
      o	Transportation networks (ports, railways, highways).

4.	Demographic Data:

  	  o	Population distribution by province (Statistics Canada).

  	  o	Labor force demographics (Statistics Canada).
