# 25-Tariff-Impact-to-Provinces-in-Canada

The goal of this project is to analyze the industrial structure of all provinces in Canada and assess the potential impact of a 25% tariff threat from the U.S. in 2025. The analysis will be conducted using GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and Power BI separately. 

1.	Objective: Understand the industrial structure of Canadian provinces and simulate the potential impact of a 25% U.S. tariff on trade, employment, and GDP.
2.	Scope: Focus on key industries (e.g., manufacturing, agriculture, energy, technology) and their geographic distribution across provinces.
3.	Outputs:
o	GIS: Spatial maps showing industrial concentration and vulnerability to tariffs.
o	Power BI: Interactive dashboards for economic and trade impact analysis.
